*** My Mouthpieces

I have a fairly large collection of French Horn mouthpieces and colleagues often ask to borrow some for trial. Don't hesitate to [[mailto:aleks@aleksozolins.com][reach out]] if you'd like to try a few.

**UPDATE 2022-07-10:** For the moment, as I shift my focus back towards software and performing music, I'm not taking on any new audio projects. This may change in the future so please don't hesitate to ask.

** Audio Editing / Production

I've produced and edited a number of recordings and work in Avid Pro Tools, although since that software is now on a subscription model, I'm looking for a good free alternate. Feel free to check out my discography for more info.

** Analog to Digital Transfers

I am equipped to transfer a variety of audio/video media to digital format including:

+ Cassette Tapes
+ 7.5 and 13 Inch Reels (Reel to Reel)
+ Vinyl (any size)
+ VHS including 8mm Super8, Hi8, and Digital8
+ Photographs
+ 35mm Slides

Media can be transferred to a variety of lossless and lossy digital formats and is provided to the customer via removeable media, web transfer, or shared via cloud services. All media is backed up both on and off site and can be redistributed to the customer in perpetuity.

Only high quality transports and converters are used for transfers to ensure the preservation of the media. Physicaly damaged media can often be repaired and media that has lost audio quality over the years can be restored with a variety of methods including:

+ Noise Removal
+ Pitch Correction
+ Dynamic Compression and Correction

Pricing is in-line with industry standards and is settled on a per-project basis. [[mailto:aleks@aleksozolins.com][email me]] to discuss your needs.
