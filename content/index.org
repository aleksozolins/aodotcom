* Music

I play the French horn professionally and am a member of [[https://local802afm.org/][The American Federation of Musicians - Local 802]]

I also occasionally do audio recording and engineering work and also play the piano/keyboard.

[[mailto:aleks@ozolins.xyz][Email me]] for my performance résumé.

** Discography

Below are commercial recordings I've had a hand in, either as a performer, or as part of the production process.

#+INCLUDE: "~/docs/denote/20240107T165523--discography__horn_recording.org" :lines "6-"

** Media

*** Images

*** Audio

*** Video

** Professional Services

**UPDATE 2022-07-10:** For the moment, as I shift my focus back towards software engineering and performing music, I'm not taking on any new recording projects. This may change in the future so please don't hesitate to ask. I'm always willing to entertain special projects or help colleagues find solutions.

*** Audio Editing / Production

I've produced and edited a number of recordings and work in Avid Pro Tools, although since that software is now on a subscription model, I'm looking for a good free alternate. Feel free to check out my discography for more info.

*** Analog to Digital Transfers

I am equipped to transfer a variety of audio/video media to digital format including:

+ Cassette Tapes
+ 7.5 and 13 Inch Reels (Reel to Reel)
+ Vinyl (any size)
+ VHS including 8mm Super8, Hi8, and Digital8
+ Photographs
+ 35mm Slides

Media can be transferred to a variety of lossless and lossy digital formats and is provided to the customer via removeable media, web transfer, or shared via cloud services. All media is backed up both on and off site and can be redistributed to the customer in perpetuity.

Only high quality transports and converters are used for transfers to ensure the preservation of the media. Physicaly damaged media can often be repaired and media that has lost audio quality over the years can be restored with a variety of methods including:

+ Noise Removal
+ Pitch Correction
+ Dynamic Compression and Correction

Pricing is in-line with industry standards and is settled on a per-project basis. [[mailto:aleks@aleksozolins.com][email me]] to discuss your needs.

** Gear

*** Horns

Here is a list of horns I own and work with. In the future, I look forward to providing some more detailed info on each here.

+ Engelbert Schmid Triple Horn in F/B/Eb (Mindelzell)
+ Alexander 103 (2018)
+ Alexander 103 (1950-60s -- I'm yet to precisely date this one)
+ Alexander single F horn (date unknown -- likely pre WW2)
+ Seraphinoff Halari hand horn
+ H Series Conn 8D (1968 -- mint condition and unmodified)

*** Mouthpieces

I have a fairly large collection of French Horn mouthpieces and colleagues often ask to borrow some for trial. Don't hesitate to [[mailto:aleks@aleksozolins.com][reach out]] if you'd like to try a few.

*Coming soon: A table of mouthpieces!*

*** Recording/Studio

Mics/interfaces/software/etc.

* Tech

** Development

I'll be including some links to software projects here in the near future.

* Library

** Reading

Ever wonder what I'm reading? Well, as of December 2023, I've started keeping track here. For transparency, I don't always finish every book I start, nor do I like all of the books I read! Don't hesitate to send me an [[mailto:aleks@ozolins.xyz][email]] if you'd like to discuss any books below.
