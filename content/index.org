* Music

I play the French horn professionally and am a member of [[https://local802afm.org/][The American Federation of Musicians - Local 802]]

I also occasionally do audio recording and engineering work and also play the piano/keyboard.

[[mailto:aleks@ozolins.xyz][Email me]] for my performance résumé.

** Discography

Below are commercial recordings I've had a hand in, either as a performer, or as part of the production process.

#+INCLUDE: "~/docs/denote/20240107T165523--discography__horn_recording.org" :lines "6-"

** Media

*** Images

*** Audio

*** Video

** Professional Services

**UPDATE 2022-07-10:** For the moment, as I shift my focus back towards software engineering and performing music, I'm not taking on any new recording projects. This may change in the future so please don't hesitate to ask. I'm always willing to entertain special projects or help colleagues find solutions.

*** Audio Editing / Production

I've produced and edited a number of recordings and work in Avid Pro Tools, although since that software is now on a subscription model, I'm looking for a good free alternate. Feel free to check out my discography for more info.

*** Analog to Digital Transfers

I am equipped to transfer a variety of audio/video media to digital format including:

+ Cassette Tapes
+ 7.5 and 13 Inch Reels (Reel to Reel)
+ Vinyl (any size)
+ VHS including 8mm Super8, Hi8, and Digital8
+ Photographs
+ 35mm Slides

Media can be transferred to a variety of lossless and lossy digital formats and is provided to the customer via removeable media, web transfer, or shared via cloud services. All media is backed up both on and off site and can be redistributed to the customer in perpetuity.

Only high quality transports and converters are used for transfers to ensure the preservation of the media. Physicaly damaged media can often be repaired and media that has lost audio quality over the years can be restored with a variety of methods including:

+ Noise Removal
+ Pitch Correction
+ Dynamic Compression and Correction

Pricing is in-line with industry standards and is settled on a per-project basis. [[mailto:aleks@aleksozolins.com][email me]] to discuss your needs.

** Gear

*** Horns

Here is a list of horns I own and work with. In the future, I look forward to providing some more detailed info on each here.

+ Engelbert Schmid Triple Horn in F/B/Eb (Mindelzell)
+ Alexander 103 (2018)
+ Alexander single F horn (date unknown -- likely pre WW2)
+ H Series Conn 8D (1968 -- mint condition and unmodified)
+ 1950s Nickel Kruspe (as new - unmodified except main tuning slide lengthened)

*** Mouthpieces

I have a fairly large collection of French Horn mouthpieces and colleagues often ask to borrow some for trial. Don't hesitate to [[mailto:aleks@aleksozolins.com][reach out]] if you'd like to try a few.

*Coming soon: A table of mouthpieces!*

*** Recording/Studio

Mics/interfaces/software/etc.

* Library

** Learning (Software Engineering)

I maintain these notes online to act as personal wikis, but you may find the information here useful as well. Notes here are taken in [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] format and published via [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html][ox-publish]] using the [[https://github.com/mrlee23/readtheorg][read-the-org]] theme.

** Reading

Ever wonder what I'm reading? Well, as of December 2023, I've started keeping track. When I start a new book, I'll list it below. For transparency, I don't always finish every book I start, nor do I like all of the books I read. I also don't endorse any of the content within them. Don't hesitate to send me an [[mailto:aleks@ozolins.xyz][email]] if you'd like to discuss any books here.

** Writing

*** Music

+ [[./venturi_article.html][The Horn Mouthpiece and Receiver Relationship: A Guide]] (*Note*: I no longer stand by this content as I have since come to understand this topic a bit differently. As such, this guide demands an update, but until then, some of the information may still be interesting.)

*** Tech

* Engineering Portfolio

I'm a developing back-end engineer. Below, you can find links to the software projects I've built and maintain.

** mouthpiecer-cli

|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| Title       | mouthpiecer-cli                                     |
| Description | TUI interface for French Horn Mouthpiece Management |
| Languages   | Python                                              |
| GitHub      | [[https://github.com/aleksozolins/mouthpiecer-cli][Link]]                                                |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------|

*Detail:* Written in Python, =mouthpiecer-cli= (which technically /should/ be called mouthpiecer-*tui*) is a terminal user interface for keeping track of your French horn mouthpiece collection. It leverages the power of [[https://knack.com][Knack]], a platform for building custom online apps, as a database back end. Interacting with Knack via its REST API, =mouthpiecer-cli= uses [[https://pandas.pydata.org/][pandas]] to display database information in the terminal, providing a simple interface for users to manage their mouthpiece collection.

|-------------+------------------------------------------|

*Note:* I'll be rewriting this in Python soon and expanding its functionality!
  
*Detail:* Written in Bash, =Aleks' Reprovisioning Script for Desktop= is designed for *personal use only*, and is aimed at automatically reprovisioning a new install of Arch Linux into a fully usable system with minimal intervention.

The script serves several functions:

- *Error Logging:* Logs errors for easy troubleshooting and debugging.
- *Dotfiles Management:* Automatically clones and stows (using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]) both public and personal dotfiles.
- *Package Installation:* Installs necessary packages from both the official Arch repositories and the AUR (using [[https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru][paru]]).
- *Password Store Setup:* Sets up the password store using [[https://www.passwordstore.org][pass]] and configures my [[https://gnupg.org/][GPG]] key.
- *Machine-Specific Configurations:* Applies machine-specific configurations to tailor the system to the specific hardware and personal preferences.
- *Printing Setup:* Sets up printing capabilities using [[https://www.cups.org/][CUPS]].
- *Window Manager Configuration:* Sets up a minimal yet fully functional tiling window manager environment using my custom build of [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][DWM]].
- *Email Synchronization:* Synchronizes email accounts using [[https://isync.sourceforge.io/mbsync.html][mbsync]] and [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/][mu]].

|-------------+------------------------------------------------|

*Detail:* The source for this website. The content itself is written in [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]. An Elisp script leverages [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/org/ox-publish.el][ox-publish]] to publish the content to HTML using a CSS template. This is wrapped in a simple build/deployment/backup script written in plain shell.
